# Authentication

The Vulcan API requires users to be authenticated to perform most actions.

In order to manage your team in Vulcan, you will need to follow three steps.

## 1. Request Vulcan access

Vulcan users are associated with an Okta user and, as such, require the user to have Okta access to the Vulcan application. In order to be able to manage your team, you will also need to be added as its owner. This operation only needs to be done once and will also allow you to invite other members to the team by yourself. To request access to the Okta application and ownership of your team, you can contact us via Slack at [#vulcan](https://sch-chat.slack.com/messages/C90P83LAY) or via email at [vulcan@adevinta.com](mailto:vulcan@adevinta.com).

## 2. Generate an API token

Once the Vulcan application is available to you, you can visit the Vulcan API [home page](https://www.vulcan.mpi-internal.com/api/v1/home) to generate an API token. This token can be used to interact with the API as your Okta user.
