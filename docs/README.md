The Vulcan API allows companies and teams using Vulcan to manage their own teams and assets. In the near future, it will also allow managing scans and the issues identified.

The [API reference](swagger/) section shows how the API works in detail. For some examples on how to manage teams and assets, you can check out the [examples](examples.md) section.

If you want to change which assets are scanned for your team or the way in which they are scanned, you may want to have a look at the [scanning](scanning.md) section.

In the [findings](findings.md) section you will find instructions on how to query the security findings detected for your team from the Vulcan API. In the [metrics](metrics.md) section you will find instructions on how to retrieve useful security metrics for your teams from the Vulcan API.
